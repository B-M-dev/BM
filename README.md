There is no progress bar for checking downloads
(you can make it up by checking the size of the ipfs directory periodically)

You cannot cancel a download while it is still in progress but you can delete 
it once it's downloaded or by restarting the app.

Update the website by manually replacing the json folder

You can use the website offline and read your downloaded manga by using this url http://0.0.0.0:3000.

You can use the one with external ip on devices connected to same LAN network as the pc you are running this from.

Execute the run script(run.sh for linux and run.bat for windows) to get the app running.
